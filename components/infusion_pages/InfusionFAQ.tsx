    question: 'Is virtual physician supervision permitted?',
    answer: `Medicare currently permits direct supervision via real-time audio/video through Dec 31, 2025 for services that require it in physician offices. Hospital outpatient therapeutic services operate under general supervision as the minimum. We implement virtual, hybrid, or on-site models consistent with these policies and your state rules/bylaws, and we update SOPs as regulations evolve.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'Which therapies are appropriate for virtual oversight?',
    answer: `Maintenance infusions (e.g., many biologics, iron, antibiotics, IV hydration) are commonly suited to virtual oversight with experienced RNs and emergency-ready protocols. Initial higher-risk doses or product changes may be scheduled with on-site physician/APP presence per policy.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'What staffing and equipment are required on-site?',
    answer: `Experienced infusion RNs, ACLS training, emergency kit (epinephrine, antihistamines, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids, oxygen), monitoring equipment, and clear escalation pathways. We help validate readiness during onboarding.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'Who are the supervising physicians?',
    answer: `Fully licensed MD/DOs, credentialed for your state(s), current on emergency care requirements, with malpractice coverage. We complete license verification, NPDB, background, and (as applicable) drug screens before first shift.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'How quickly can we go live?',
    answer: `Many outpatient centers launch within 2â€“4 weeks depending on credentialing and state requirements. We schedule coverage blocks in advance and can scale hours as demand grows.`,
  },
